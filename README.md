# imaging_application
Repository with basic Vison and imaging algorithms implemented in C++

Currently contains following algorithms implemented in c++

- Median filter
- Gaussian filter
- Sobel edge
- Canny edge
- Hough transform
- Harris Corner detection
- utility to draw a line
- utility to draw a circle
- utility to draw a rectangle with any orientation

Note:: the agorithms are not fully tested for corner conditions, Idea here was to learn the algorithms more effectively by implementing in c++

The optimiztions will be added in the future to make the algorithms more robust and as real time as possible
